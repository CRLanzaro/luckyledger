# Ethereum Lottery DApp

A decentralized lottery application built on Ethereum using **Solidity**, **React**, **Tailwind CSS**, and **Web3.js**. Users can enter a lottery by purchasing tickets, and a random winner is drawn once the raffle ends.

## Features

- **Create Raffles**: Hosts can create new raffles with a defined entry fee and duration.
- **Buy Tickets**: Users can buy tickets for raffles using Ethereum.
- **Draw Winners**: Hosts can draw a random winner once the raffle expires.
- **Web3 Integration**: Interacts with the Ethereum blockchain using Web3.js.

## Installation

### Prerequisites

- **Node.js** (v14 or higher)
- **npm** (v6 or higher)
- **Ganache** (for local Ethereum testing, optional for development)
- **Truffle** (if you're using Truffle to deploy your contracts)

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/JSDWRLD/luckyledger.git
cd luckyledger
```

### 2. Install Dependencies

Install both frontend and backend dependencies.

#### Frontend (React and Tailwind CSS)

```bash
npm install
```

#### Install Truffle

If you're using **Truffle**, install Truffle and Ganache:

```bash
npm install -g truffle
```

### 3. Run the Development Server

For the frontend, start the React development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

This will open your app at `http://localhost:3000`.

If you're running **Ganache** locally for Ethereum simulation, start it using the following command:

```bash
ganache-cli -m "six radar life middle supply morning idle jeans picture room put effort" -p 7545
```

This will start Ganache with the same mnemonic each time to ensure your wallets are consistent.

### 4. Deploy the Smart Contract

Make sure to have your smart contract (Solidity) compiled and deployed to the Ethereum network. If using **Truffle**, run the following:

```bash
truffle migrate --network development
```

### 5. Connect to Ethereum Network

Ensure the Web3.js integration in the frontend connects to the correct network (local Ganache).
